- Push and commit changes from the local development environment to the staging branch on GitHub.
- Review the code and conduct tests in the staging environment to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

2. **Production Process**
- Once the staging tests are successful, merge the staging branch into the `main` branch.
- Deploy the `main` branch to the production environment on AWS Lightsail.
- Monitor the deployment for any issues and ensure that the site is live and functioning correctly.

### Team Communication and Collaboration
1. **Slack**: 
- Use Slack for real-time communication, project updates, and issue tracking.
- Channels for development, testing, and deployment should be established for better coordination.

2. **GitHub Projects**: 
- Utilize GitHub Projects to track tasks, manage issues, and monitor the progress of the development cycle.
- Assign tasks to team members, set deadlines, and track milestones to ensure timely delivery of the project.
